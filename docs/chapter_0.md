## What Makes Jac Special?

Jac offers a unique approach to programming by combining established concepts with new features tailored for AI development. Here are some of the key elements that set it apart:

- **Object-Spatial Programming**: Jac introduces a new way to think about programming by allowing computation to happen where the data is located.[2] This approach is particularly useful for applications with connected data, like social networks or file systems, and helps make them easier to scale.
- **Scale-Agnostic Architecture**: You can write your code once and run it on your local machine or scale it for the cloud without making changes to the code itself.
- **AI-First Design**: Jac is designed with artificial intelligence at its core, providing built-in capabilities for AI without the need for complex integrations.
- **Zero-Configuration Deployment**: Jac automates the process of generating APIs and managing data persistence, which simplifies the deployment of your applications.
